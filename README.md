# 💫 About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm a software engineer born and raised in **Queens, NY**, with roots in **Mexico** 🇲🇽 and a love for **volleyball** 🏐.

💡 My journey into tech started when I built a Wix website for a friend’s event. That moment sparked a deep curiosity about how websites work — and led me to **The Marcy Lab School**, a highly selective, intensive one-year program where I developed full-stack skills by building real-world projects.

🛠️ One of my proudest projects is **GeneralWoodFloors**, a full-stack website I’m building for my father’s small business. I self-taught **Python in just a month** and used **Django + PostgreSQL** to build the backend. This project let me combine my passion for tech with my desire to support family and community.

🚀 I’m passionate about **empowering small businesses** with technology and am excited about opportunities where I can make a positive impact through **scalable and efficient software solutions**. I’m especially interested in working with organizations focused on **innovation and community**.

🎯 I’m currently enrolled in the **Career Launch Accelerator (CLA)** at The Marcy Lab School, receiving continued job search support and attending networking events.

🤝 Thanks for stopping by! I’d love to learn more about **you** and what you do. Feel free to connect or reach out!
